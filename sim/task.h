 * <pre>void vTaskDelay( const TickType_t xTicksToDelay );</pre>
 *
 * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the
 * task remains blocked depends on the tick rate.  The constant
 * portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
 * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the
 * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.
 *
 * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that
 * the calling task should block.
 *
 * Example usage:

 void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
 {
 // Block for 500ms.
 const TickType_t xDelay = 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS;

	 for( ;; )
	 {
		 // Simply toggle the LED every 500ms, blocking between each toggle.
		 vToggleLED();
		 vTaskDelay( xDelay );
	 }

 *
 * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
 * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
 * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
 * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
 * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
 * using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * See xTaskCreateStatic() for a version that does not use any dynamic memory
 * allocation.
 *
 * xTaskCreate() can only be used to create a task that has unrestricted
 * access to the entire microcontroller memory map.  Systems that include MPU
 * support can alternatively create an MPU constrained task using
 * xTaskCreateRestricted().
 *
 * @param pvTaskCode Pointer to the task entry function.  Tasks
 * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).
 *
 * @param pcName A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to
 * facilitate debugging.  Max length defined by configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN - default
 * is 16.
 *
 * @param usStackDepth The size of the task stack specified as the number of
 * variables the stack can hold - not the number of bytes.  For example, if
 * the stack is 16 bits wide and usStackDepth is defined as 100, 200 bytes
 * will be allocated for stack storage.
 *
 * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
 * being created.
 *
 * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task should run.  Systems that
 * include MPU support can optionally create tasks in a privileged (system)
 * mode by setting bit portPRIVILEGE_BIT of the priority parameter.  For
 * example, to create a privileged task at priority 2 the uxPriority parameter
 * should be set to ( 2 | portPRIVILEGE_BIT ).
 *
 * @param pvCreatedTask Used to pass back a handle by which the created task
 * can be referenced.
 *
 * @return pdPASS if the task was successfully created and added to a ready
 * list, otherwise an error code defined in the file projdefs.h

 *
 * When configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS is set to one each task has its own private
 * "notification value", which is a 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t).
 *
 * Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object.  Examples of such
 * objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups.  Task notifications
 * are a method of sending an event directly to a task without the need for such
 * an intermediary object.
 *
 * A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as
 * update, overwrite or increment the task's notification value.  In that way
 * task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as light
 * weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.
 *
 * xTaskNotifyGive() is a helper macro intended for use when task notifications
 * are used as light weight and faster binary or counting semaphore equivalents.
 * Actual FreeRTOS semaphores are given using the xSemaphoreGive() API function,
 * the equivalent action that instead uses a task notification is
 * xTaskNotifyGive().
 *
 * When task notifications are being used as a binary or counting semaphore
 * equivalent then the task being notified should wait for the notification
 * using the ulTaskNotificationTake() API function rather than the
 * xTaskNotifyWait() API function.
 *
 * See http://www.FreeRTOS.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html for more details.
 *
 * @param xTaskToNotify The handle of the task being notified.  The handle to a
 * task can be returned from the xTaskCreate() API function used to create the
 * task, and the handle of the currently running task can be obtained by calling
 * xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle().
